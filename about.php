<h2 class="intro-title">What Is ShopCampus</h2>
<p class="intro-desc" style="color:black;">ShopCampus Is a Campus based platform which brings students together for buying and selling of secondhand products.We Have dreamed
of a campus community where nothing gets wasted at all,Having a platform where neglected,rejected,extra or unuseful old/new stuffs gets new owners to whom
they may be their first ones to own.A onestop online classified ads site where something as cheap as a pencil and as expensive as a laptop can be put on sale!</p>
<p style="color:black;">Being a colleged based classified ads site,ShopCampus enables students who would like to dispose off their products do it with ease by just uploading them
to the platform and leaving the work of linking them to potential buyers to us.Also those interested in buying stuffs can search through the platform with help
of our advanced search algorithms and get what they need at low cost.</p>

<h2 class="intro-title">Why ShopCampus</h2>
<p class="intro-desc" style="color:black;">Think of a campus setup with food canteens,printing booths,beuty shops,Playgrounds but lacking one essential facility,A place where 
students can connect to buy and sell used products like mobile phones,laptops,books among themselves? Our main goal in Shopcampus was to bridge the gap
between sellers and buyers in a college setup.
Shopcampus will be the first ever campus based classified ads site evolving around student environment.We are looking to having an essential platform where
after using your calculator for four years,you can put it on sale and get a customer within hours.</p>

<h2 class="intro-title">ShopCampus Stores</h2>
<p class="intro-desc">We Believe In a college setup,a student can have more than one product to sell/dispose.Think of a student who sells sneaker shoes,cooking
gas or has a gas refilling business and has no capital to set up a physical shop?
ShopCampus has a stores feature which enables one to open a fully branded online store where he/she can list his/her products and connect with customers.
